| 16 | Squarespace        |          5 | On a tactical note, I do think Squarespace hires for summer interns during the prior fall semester (so extended offers for summer 2023 interns in fall 2022), but there are definitely some companies who hire all throughout the spring to find summer interns. As a junior at Brandeis, I didn't receive an internship offer until April (this was in 2014). Hiatt used to have some partnerhips/listings for local companies who wanted to hire software development interns, and I believe that's how I was connected with Milcord which is a small R&D firm in Waltham. | https://www.squarespace.com/careers/early-career                                                                                                                                              |
